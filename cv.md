## About Me

Having started my career as an employee in local printing office I gained experience in designing lots of printing content. In a free time I was learning basics of HTML, CSS and JS. Main reason I was interested in web development is instantly seeing results of your work just like in designing process. While studing JS I realised that I very much enjoy the succsess of compliting the tasks. The more complex the task was the more saticfied I felt. I have decided I should study web develompent (specificly front-end) in a more systematic and deep way. That's why I signed up for a RSS JS course.

In my previous job I have developed good communication skills. It was easy for me to work in a team and my boss considered me as an reliable worker. I belive that skills I got working there would help me to start a new career as Front-End developer. I'm very excited for the cource and can't wail to learn and develop new skills.
